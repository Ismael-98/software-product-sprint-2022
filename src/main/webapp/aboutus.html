<h1>Where health is concerned, understanding what is in your food is more important now than ever before. Many people have allergies and restrictions that limit what they can eat, and unfortunately, this results in lots of time spent reading the ingredient lists on packages before allowing themselves to eat it. Additionally, packaging varies heavily in its design; it can be hard to read, have dense and unfamiliar industry jargon, or be unavailable on a barcode-based database.</h1>
<h1>Google Food was made to improve the quality of life of individuals with stricter than normal dietary restrictions. Rather than having to spend time manually reading ingredient labels, users of our product will receive the benefit of a streamlined process that provides results in an intuitive and efficient manner. Ingredients matter, and Google Food analyzes ingredients by looking past pretty packaging and clever marketing tactics to break down whatâ€™s really in your food.

          <h4 style="font-weight: 300;">Hello everyone! In this project, I worked on connecting a database so that it would be visible and organized by using Google Charts, as well as it being responsive to the search bar. I also created this about us page to share our mission! I designed alongside Oluwamayokun to ensure our user-facing systems were simple, clean, and easy for everyone to use.
